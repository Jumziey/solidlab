1. Current Reversal, Delta method or Offset-Compensated

2. Non ohmic contacts. - should lead to offset voltage in circuit. SHEILD and ground.

3. Device heating - One shot trigger (Maybe combine with reversal?(look at emf creation)) 
	Remember to configurate DMM for low resistance measurements.
	It shall be said that since we control temperature this should not be that horrible, but worth exploring.

4. SUPERCONDUCTER MEASUREMENT
	Samples critical current
	voltage leads should mave low seebeck coefficient wrt sample
	use current-reversal.
